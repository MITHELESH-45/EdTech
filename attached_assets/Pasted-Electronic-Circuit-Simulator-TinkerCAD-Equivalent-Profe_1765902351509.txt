Electronic Circuit Simulator – TinkerCAD-Equivalent Professional Rebuild (Frontend Only)
ROLE

You are a senior frontend engineer and electronics simulation architect who has deep experience with educational simulators like TinkerCAD Circuits and Wokwi.

I already have an existing frontend-only electronic circuit simulator, but it has major functional, architectural, and visual flaws.

Your task is to analyze, debug, refactor, and complete the simulator professionally, using TinkerCAD Circuits as the primary reference for component clarity, pin layout, and behavior — while producing original implementation and assets.

⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

First analyze the existing codebase completely

Identify:

Wiring inefficiencies

Incorrect simulation logic

Poor component rendering

Fix issues without breaking what already works

If an error appears:

Re-analyze

Fix

Re-test

Do NOT stop halfway

Deliver a stable, scalable, production-quality frontend

🎯 CORE OBJECTIVE

Transform the project from:

“Basic visual circuit builder”

into:

A TinkerCAD-equivalent educational circuit simulator (frontend-only)

1️⃣ COMPONENT DESIGN — TINKERCAD-EQUIVALENT (MANDATORY)
Reference Standard

Use TinkerCAD Circuits as the functional and visual reference for:

Component shape

Pin placement

Pin naming

User clarity

Educational readability

⚠️ Do NOT copy proprietary assets directly.
✅ Recreate original SVGs that are functionally and visually equivalent.

Components must include (at minimum):

Breadboard

Arduino Uno

ESP32

LED

Resistor

Buzzer

Push Button

Potentiometer

Servo Motor

Ultrasonic Sensor

IR Sensor

DHT11

Power Supply / Battery

Ground rail

Each component must have:

Clearly visible pins

Pin labels exactly as in real hardware

Hover tooltips

Clickable snap points

Zoom-safe readability

2️⃣ MICROCONTROLLERS — PROFESSIONAL GRADE

Arduino & ESP32 must NOT be simple images.

Visual Requirements:

SVG-based board design

Realistic pin layout (like TinkerCAD)

Clearly visible:

VCC

GND

GPIO

PWM pins

Logical Requirements:

Each pin must have:

Mode (INPUT / OUTPUT)

Voltage / signal state

Connection to electrical nets

Pins must drive or read nets, not act as decorations.

3️⃣ TERMINAL-BASED WIRING SYSTEM (CRITICAL)

Wiring must work exactly like TinkerCAD:

Wires connect ONLY pin → pin

No body connections

No free-space connections

UX Flow:

Click a pin → wire starts

Valid pins highlight

Wire snaps on target pin

Invalid connections blocked

4️⃣ ELECTRICAL SIMULATION ENGINE (SCALABLE)

Build a graph-based simulation engine.

Core entities:
Component
Terminal
Wire
Net
Circuit

Simulation flow:
RUN →
Build Nets →
Group Nets into Circuits →
Assign Power & Ground →
Propagate Voltages →
Evaluate Components →
Update Visual State

5️⃣ MULTIPLE CIRCUITS SUPPORT

Users can create multiple independent circuits

Each circuit must:

Simulate independently

Not interfere with others

Circuit grouping must be based only on connectivity

6️⃣ COMPONENT LOGIC — NO COMBINATIONS

🚫 Do NOT write logic like:

LED + Arduino

LED + Sensor

✅ Correct approach:

One universal electrical engine

Each component defines only its own electrical behavior

component.evaluate(connectedNets)


This must scale cleanly to 20+ components.

7️⃣ BREADBOARD — REAL INTERNAL CONNECTIONS

Breadboard must:

Implement internal row connectivity

Implement power rails

Behave exactly like a real breadboard (TinkerCAD-style)

Without this, the simulator is invalid.

8️⃣ ERROR DETECTION & AUTO-VALIDATION

Detect and handle:

No ground

Reverse polarity

Open circuit

Short circuit

Display clear warnings and prevent invalid simulation states.

9️⃣ DEBUG PANEL (MANDATORY)

Provide a debug mode showing:

Detected circuits

Nets and voltages

Signal states

Component evaluation results

This is required for correctness and future extension.

⚙️ TECH CONSTRAINTS

Frontend only (JS / TS / React)

Canvas or SVG rendering

No backend

No external simulation APIs

No API keys

Clean, modular, commented code

✅ FINAL DELIVERABLE EXPECTATION

After completion:

Components look and feel like TinkerCAD-quality equivalents

Pins are clear, visible, and usable

Wiring is smooth and intuitive

Simulation logic is correct and scalable

Multiple circuits work simultaneously

Adding a new component requires minimal code

Architecture is future-ready

❗ FINAL DIRECTIVE

This is a professional rebuild, not a cosmetic fix.

If something fails:

Re-check

Correct

Validate

Deliver a working result
