🌱 E-GROOTS
Learning-First Electronics & IoT Simulation Platform
(Frontend-Only, Scalable MVP)
🧠 START OF PROMPT

(READ CAREFULLY — DO NOT SKIP ANY PART)

You are a principal frontend engineer, UI/UX architect, and product designer specializing in clean, professional SaaS platforms and educational engineering tools.

Your task is to build a frontend-only MVP for a platform named E-GROOTS.

The design must be:

Light themed

Minimal

Aesthetic

Professional

Calm and learning-focused

This MVP must look production-ready, investor-ready, and hackathon-ready, even though it contains no backend yet.

🏷️ PRODUCT IDENTITY

App Name: E-GROOTS
Tagline:

Learn Electronics. Simulate Visually. Build Confidently.

Product Vision

E-GROOTS is a learning-first electronics & IoT education platform where users:

📘 Learn electronics through structured courses

🔌 Practice concepts using an interactive electronic simulator

🌐 Later expand into IoT & no-code workflows

The platform should feel like a modern digital electronics lab, not a gaming app and not a flashy futuristic UI.

🚫 STRICT CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ No backend

❌ No API calls

❌ No database

❌ No authentication logic

❌ No Wokwi

❌ No PCB Design module

❌ No API keys

⚠️ Important:
Even though this is frontend-only, the project structure MUST be scalable so backend, APIs, auth, DB, and AI can be added later without refactoring.

🧱 REQUIRED TECH STACK (MANDATORY)

Use ONLY:

Next.js (App Router)

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

GSAP → minimal animations only

Three.js → very subtle depth only (optional, not heavy)

Clean, modular folder structure

🎨 GLOBAL THEME (VERY IMPORTANT)
Visual Theme: Light, Aesthetic, Professional Electronics Lab

Apply across the entire app:

🤍 Light background (off-white / soft gray)

🎨 Soft accent colors (blue, teal, green)

🧠 Clean cards & panels (no glassmorphism)

🧩 Subtle electronics-inspired illustrations

🖥️ Looks like a real educational SaaS product

Animation Style

Minimal

Calm

Smooth

Purposeful

No glowing neon

No heavy motion

🧭 CORE USER FLOW

Assume user is already logged in

User lands on Learning Dashboard

Dashboard shows Courses to Learn

A left-side tool panel shows:

Electronic Simulation

IoT Simulation (Coming Soon)

No-Code Editor (Coming Soon)

User opens Electronic Simulation

Other tools remain visible but disabled

🏠 HEADER (GLOBAL)

Present on dashboard & all pages.

Header must include:

E-GROOTS logo (simple icon + text)

Search input (for courses – UI only)

Profile avatar (static)

Clicking opens profile dropdown (UI only)

Header must be:

Minimal

Sticky

Clean

Professional

🏠 MAIN PAGE — LEARNING DASHBOARD
Route: /dashboard
Purpose

Primary landing page after login.
Learning is the focus, not tools.

DASHBOARD FEATURES
1️⃣ Course Listing Section

Display a grid of course cards.

Each course card MUST include:

Course title

Short description

Difficulty badge

Progress bar (mock)

“Start Learning” button

Example Courses

Basics of Electronics

Digital Electronics Fundamentals

Arduino for Beginners

Sensors & Actuators

IoT Basics (Locked / Coming Soon)

UX Requirements

Subtle GSAP hover fade / lift

No 3D tilt here

Clean typography

Calm colors

📚 COURSE EXPERIENCE (VISUAL ONLY)

Clicking a course opens a lesson UI

Lessons contain:

Headings

Text

Simple diagram placeholders

End of lesson CTA:

“Practice this concept in Electronic Simulation”

(No real navigation logic required)

ℹ️ ABOUT US PAGE
Route: /about

Explain clearly:

What E-GROOTS is

Who it is for (students, beginners, engineers)

What problems it solves

Future vision (IoT, No-Code, AI)

This page must be:

Clean

Informative

Minimal

Professional

🧭 SIDE PANEL — TOOL NAVIGATION

Left-side vertical panel.

Tools

🔌 Electronic Simulation (Active)

🌐 IoT Simulation (Coming Soon)

🧩 No-Code Editor (Coming Soon)

Behavior

Electronic Simulation → navigates

Others → disabled with “Coming Soon”

🔌 ELECTRONIC SIMULATION MODULE
Route: /electronic-simulation

This is the core practice tool.

🧱 ELECTRONIC SIMULATION — LAYOUT
3-Column Clean Lab Layout
🔹 LEFT PANEL — Component Palette

Scrollable

Component cards with:

Image / SVG icon (not blocks)

Label

Components (v1 – expanded)

Base

LED

Resistor

Button

Buzzer

Potentiometer

Power

5V

GND

Boards

Arduino UNO

ESP32

Structure

Breadboard

Jumper Wires

Clicking a component places its image on canvas.

🔹 CENTER PANEL — Circuit Canvas

This should feel like a real electronics workspace.

Features

Light grid background

Breadboard placed on canvas

Components placed on breadboard

Manual wire connections

User selects wire

Click pin → click another pin

Wires drawn as curved SVG lines

Active wires change color (subtle)

⚠️ No heavy animation here — usability first.

🔹 RIGHT PANEL — Controls & Status
Controls

Run Simulation

Stop Simulation

Reset Circuit

Status

Simulation state

LED ON / OFF

Error messages (mock)

Example error:

“LED requires a resistor in series”

🎬 ANIMATION RULES (IMPORTANT)
Use GSAP ONLY for:

Page fade transitions

Panel slide-in

Component placement fade-in

Button hover micro-interactions

Do NOT:

Use flashy animations

Use pulsing neon

Use continuous motion

🧠 MOCK SIMULATION LOGIC (FRONTEND ONLY)

Use React state.

Example:

If LED + Resistor + Power + GND connected → LED ON

Else → LED OFF + error

No electronics math.
