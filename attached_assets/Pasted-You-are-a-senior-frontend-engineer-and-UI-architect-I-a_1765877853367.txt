You are a senior frontend engineer and UI architect.

I already have a generated frontend, but it has multiple functional and UX issues.
Your task is to FIX and EXTEND the existing frontend WITHOUT breaking current structure.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT remove existing files unless necessary
- Reuse existing components where possible
- Write clean, modular, readable code
- Add comments where logic is non-trivial
- Ensure all features work end-to-end visually and logically

=====================================================
1) LOGIN / SIGNUP PAGE (TEMP AUTH)
=====================================================

- Build a Login & Signup page UI
- For now, authentication is TEMPORARY:
  → Any entered email + password should successfully log the user in
- No backend validation required
- Store logged-in user info in:
  → localStorage (userId, email, name)
- After login/signup, redirect to Dashboard/Home
- Add basic form validation (required fields)

=====================================================
2) USER PROFILE PAGE
=====================================================

- Create a Profile page for each logged-in user
- Fetch user data from localStorage
- Display:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Joined date (mock)
- Add "Edit Profile" (UI only, no backend)
- Add Logout button:
  → clears localStorage
  → redirects to Login page

=====================================================
3) HELP / CONTACT PAGE
=====================================================

- Build a Help page with a Contact Form
- Fields:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Subject
  - Message
- On submit:
  → Show success message (mock submit)
  → No backend required
- Add basic validation and clean UI

=====================================================
4) COURSES PAGE – LEVELS + YOUTUBE + NOTES
=====================================================

- In Courses section:
  - Clicking a Course Card opens Course Levels
- Each Level should contain:
  - Level name
  - YouTube video link (opens YouTube in new tab)
  - Downloadable Notes (PDF / placeholder file)
- Proper navigation between:
  Course → Levels → External YouTube
- Ensure responsive layout

=====================================================
5) COMPONENT TERMINALS (POSITIVE / NEGATIVE / PINS)
=====================================================

- For EACH circuit component:
  - Clearly visible terminals / pins
  - Example:
    - LED → Anode (+), Cathode (-)
    - Resistor → Terminal A, Terminal B
    - Sensors → VCC, GND, DATA
- Terminals must be visible and clickable
- Add visual indicators (small circles / labels)

=====================================================
6) DELETE COMPONENT LOGIC
=====================================================

- User should be able to delete a selected component by:
  - Pressing DELETE key
  - Pressing ESC key
- When deleted:
  - Component is removed from circuit
  - All connected wires are also removed
- Add clear selection highlight when component is clicked

=====================================================
7) ADD & FIX COMPONENTS
=====================================================

FIX VISIBILITY ISSUES:
- Buzzer → visible when added
- ESP32 → visible and draggable

ADD NEW COMPONENTS:
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- IR Sensor
- DHT11 Sensor
- Servo Motor
- ESP32 Microcontroller

FOR EACH COMPONENT:
- Proper pin layout
- Clear labels
- Correct default orientation
- Pins must be connectable

=====================================================
8) WIRE CONNECTION LOGIC (STRICT)
=====================================================

- Wires MUST connect ONLY between terminals
- Disallow free-floating wire connections
- Flow:
  Terminal → Wire → Terminal
- Highlight terminal when wire is near
- Prevent invalid connections visually

=====================================================
9) CIRCUIT LOGIC CORRECTION
=====================================================

CURRENT ISSUE:
- LED glows regardless of wiring

FIX:
- Implement basic electrical logic simulation:
  - LED glows ONLY if:
    - Proper polarity
    - Power source connected
    - Circuit is complete
- Apply same validation logic to ALL components
- Invalid wiring → no output

=====================================================
FINAL REQUIREMENTS
=====================================================

- Improve UI/UX (selection, hover, feedback)
- Keep the app stable
- Do not introduce breaking changes
- Ensure all new features are DEMO-READY

Deliver:
- Updated frontend code
- Clear structure
- Fully working interactions
